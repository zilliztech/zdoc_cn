```javascript
await milvusClient.delete({
   db_name: string,
   collection_name: string,
   partition_name?: string,
   ids: string[] | number[],
   consistency_level: string,
   timeout?: number
 })
```

**PARAMETERS:**

- **db_name** (*string*) -

    The name of the database that holds the target collection.

- **collection_name** (*string*) -

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The name of an existing collection.

- **partition_name** (*string*) -

{
    succ_index: number[],
    err_index: number[],
    acknowledged: boolean,
    insert_cnt: string,
    delete_cnt: string,
    upsert_cnt: string,
    timestamp: string,
    IDs: { int_id?: { data: number[] }, str_id?: { data: string[] }, id_field: 'int_id' | 'str_id' },
    status:  ResStatus
}
```

**PARAMETERS:**

- **succ_index** (*number[]*) -
The zero-based positions of input IDs that matched a row and were marked deleted.

- **err_index** (*number[]*) -
The zero-based positions of input IDs that did not match any row.

- **acknowledged** (*boolean*) -
Whether the delete was acknowledged by Milvus.
