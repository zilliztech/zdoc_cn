# get_replicas()

This operation gets information about the current loaded replica.

## Request Syntax

```python
get_replicas(
    timeout: float | None
)
```

**PARAMETERS:**

- **timeout** (*float* | *None*)  

    The timeout duration for this operation. Setting this to **None** indicates that this operation timeouts when any response arrives or any error occurs.

**RETURN TYPE:**

*Replica*

**RETURNS:**

A **Replica** object that contains the following fields:

- **groups** (*list*)

    A list of replica groups. Each **Group** objects that contains the following fields:

    - **id** (*int*)

        The group ID.

    - **group_nodes** (*tuple*)

        A tuple containing the IDs of the involved query nodes.

    - **resource_group** (*str*)

        The name of the resource group to which the above query nodes belong.

    - **shards** (*list*)  

        A list of **Shard** objects that contains the following fields:

        - **channel_name** (*str*)

        - **shard_leader** (*int*)

        - **shard_nodes** (*set*)

<Admonition type="info" icon="📘" title="What is a replica?">

<p>With replicas, Zilliz Cloud can load the same segments on multiple query nodes. If one query node has failed or is busy with a current search request when another arrives, the system can send new requests to an idle query node that has a replication of the same segment. </p>
<p>Replicas are organized as replica groups. Each replica group contains <a href="https://milvus.io/docs/v2.1.x/glossary.md#Sharding">shard</a> replicas. Each shard replica has a streaming replica and a historical replica that correspond to the growing and sealed <a href="https://milvus.io/docs/v2.1.x/glossary.md#Segment">segments</a> in the shard.</p>
<p>Shards can be regarded as DML channels for distributed data write operations among multiple nodes to make the most of the parallel computing potential out of a Zilliz Cloud cluster.</p>

**EXCEPTIONS:**

None

## Examples

```python
from pymilvus import Collection, Partition

collection = Collection(name="test_collection")

# Get an existing partition
partition = Partition(collection, name="test_partition")

# Get the information about the current loaded replicas
partition.get_replicas()
```
