# Zilliz Plugin Examples

In this guide, you will find more examples that use natural language to provision infrastructure, perform data operations, back up and restore your data across clusters, and implement access control for the sake of cluster security.

You: "Search for 5 similar products to vector [0.1, 0.2, ...]"
Plugin: Executes vector search and returns results
```

## Example 3: Backup and Restore\{#example-3-backup-and-restore}

**Scenario**: Set up automated backups

```plaintext
You: "Create a backup policy for my production cluster with daily backups and 7-day retention"
Plugin: Configures backup policy

You: "Create a backup of the users collection right now"

## Example 4: Access Control\{#example-4-access-control}

**Scenario**: Set up RBAC for team members
