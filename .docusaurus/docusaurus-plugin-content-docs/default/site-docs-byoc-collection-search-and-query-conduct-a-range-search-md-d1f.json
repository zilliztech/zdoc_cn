  "description": "Understanding how to filter your search results by the proximity of entities is crucial in vector operations. A range search serves this exact purpose by narrowing down results according to the distance between a query vector and vectors. This guide will walk you through the process of conducting a range search in Zilliz Cloud, which consists of a vector similarity search followed by distance-based filtering.",
